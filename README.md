# Browser-Extension-Security
Identified and removed risky Chrome extensions to improve browser security.
## Objective
To identify browser extensions that may pose security or privacy risks and remove them safely.

## Steps I Followed
1. Opened Chrome and navigated to `chrome://extensions` to view all installed extensions.
2. Reviewed permissions and developer details for each extension.
3. Found two suspicious extensions:
   - **Sound Booster – increase volume up**
   - **Sound Booster VMax | FREE Increase Volume Up**
4. Both extensions requested permission to *“Read and change all your data on all websites”*, which is excessive for a simple sound booster.
5. Verified online that many similar extensions have been flagged for injecting ads or tracking users.
6. Removed both extensions and restarted the browser.
7. Confirmed that system performance and browser responsiveness improved afterward.

## Suspicious Extensions Found and Removed
| Extension Name | Version | Permission | Action Taken |
|----------------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Sound Booster – increase volume up | 1.0.10 | Read and change all your data on all websites | Removed |
| Sound Booster VMax | 0.1.2 | Read and change all your data on all websites | Removed |

## Safe Extensions Kept
- Google Docs Offline  
- Merlin – Ask AI to Research, Write & Review  
- Volume Master  
- Office – Enable Copy and Paste (disabled, no longer supported)

## Outcome
I learned how to identify browser extensions with overreaching permissions that can access sensitive browsing data. Extensions that request full access to all websites should be avoided unless from a trusted developer.
